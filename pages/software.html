With the power of a Reginald Systems server and our official Recepie Storing and Sorting software this issue can be a thing of the past. <br>This application runs on your server, allowing you to upload files to it containing your recipes. Our app will then scan them and automatically sort them for you. All of your precious recipes will be accessible on your mobile device at the touch of a finger. Our app can even recommend recipies that you haven't tried in a while. Need to quickly send your sister a recipe that she is asking for? Just push the share button on the app and we'll take care of the rest.</p>
