        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>We are Reginald Systems. We were founded in late 2021 from as an idea made in college. Our founded got a bunch of his fellow CS students together and began working on our founding product, The Reginald. Originally The Reginald was a simple machine, a home server. We were founded on the belief that everyone can benefit from the advantages of a home server. However, not everyone has the know-how to creat or maintain a home server themselves. </p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>We believe that the advantages of home server that we know from experience should be available to everyone. However, we know that we have much more technical knowledge and comfort setting up and maintaining these types of servers. That is why we have created software that performs these functions on its own. We sell servers and provide applications that you can simply install and forget about while reaping the benefits and ease of use. </p>
