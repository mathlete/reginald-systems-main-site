Things to do:
make navbar and footer.
        make sure that everything in them has a common class that can be deliniated from everything else in css.
        look up if an unknown number of steps can be taken in css selectors (have one main div that wraps everything and select that way instead of common class.)
Make github repo.
Make skeleton of all pages as seen in phone pic

More things to do:
	Write more styles for header so that is sticks to the top of the page(same for footer on bottom)
